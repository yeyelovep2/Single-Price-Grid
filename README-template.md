## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css
.section {
  display: block;
  flex-direction: column-reverse;
}
```

This was used in my media query, based on my research i noticed when you use 'display: flex' in your css, it's advisable to use 'display: block' to counter it.


### Continued development

I'm making gradual progress in my media query but only one screen, i hope to be able to do multiple screens.
